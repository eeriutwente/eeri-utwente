EERI is a multi-disciplinary project supported by the Faculty of EEMCS at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. We will work on improving the resilience and the energy efficiency of the communication networks. The team consists of three faculty members from Mathematics, Electrical-Engineering, and Computer Science, and three Ph.D. students from these three disciplines.
