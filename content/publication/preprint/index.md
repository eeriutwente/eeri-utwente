title: Degree distributions in AB random geometric graphs
abstract: >-
  In this paper, we provide degree distributions for AB random geometric

  graphs, in which points of type A connect to the closest k points of type B.

  The motivating example to derive such degree distributions is in 5G wireless

  networks with multi-connectivity, where users connect to their closest k base

  stations. In this setting, it is important to know how many users a particular

  base station serves, which gives the degree of that base station. To obtain

  these degree distributions, we investigate the distribution of area sizes of the

  k−th order Voronoi cells of B-points. Assuming that the A-points are Poisson

  distributed, we investigate the amount of users connected to a certain B-point,

  which is equal to the degree of this point. In the simple case where the Bpoints are placed in an hexagonal grid, we show that all k-th order Voronoi

  areas are equal and thus all degrees follow a Poisson distribution. However,

  this observation does not hold for Poisson distributed B-points, for which we

  show that the degree distribution follows a compound Poisson-Erlang distribution in the 1-dimensional case. We then approximate the degree distribution

  in the 2-dimensional case with a compound Poisson-Gamma degree distribution and show that this one-parameter fit performs well for different values

  of k. Moreover, we show that for increasing k, these degree distributions become more concentrated around the mean. This means that k-connected AB

  random graphs balance the loads of B-type nodes more evenly as k increases.

  Finally, we provide a case study on real data of base stations.
